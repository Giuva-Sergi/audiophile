## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a fully functional e-commerce website based on a provided design, under the brand name "Audiophile". The challenge is to get the website looking as close as possible to the design, while also implementing full interactivity and responsiveness.

The website includes:
- A product gallery with detailed pages for each item.
- A shopping cart where users can add, remove, and adjust quantities of products.
- A complete checkout process including form validation, order summary, and confirmation modal.

If you want to push it further, you can build a backend or use a headless CMS to provide product data dynamically. For simplicity, a `data.json` file is provided for the product information.

## Features

- **Add/Remove Products from Cart**: Users can add and remove products with ease.
- **Edit Product Quantities in Cart**: Quantities of each product can be updated directly in the cart.
- **Checkout Form**: Users fill out personal and payment details with real-time validation.
- **Order Confirmation**: Display a summary of the order after successful checkout.
- **Persistent Cart**: Items in the cart are saved in local storage so they are not lost upon refreshing the browser.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, providing an optimal experience across different screen sizes.
- **Hover States**: All interactive elements include hover states to improve user experience.
- **Shipping and VAT Calculations**: Shipping is a flat $50, and VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total (excluding shipping).
